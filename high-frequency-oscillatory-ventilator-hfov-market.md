<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilator (HFOV) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV) is a specialized mechanical ventilation technique that uses rapid, small tidal volumes to improve gas exchange while minimizing lung injury. The market for HFOV is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive HFOV requires endotracheal intubation for direct airway access, primarily used in critical care settings. In contrast, non-invasive HFOV employs facial masks or nasal interfaces, offering a gentler approach to ventilation, often used in less severe cases or during transport.</p></p>

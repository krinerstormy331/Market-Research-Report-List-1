<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Filters & Purification Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reverse Osmosis</li><li>Ultrafiltration Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water filters and purification market encompasses various technologies, including reverse osmosis (RO) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. Reverse osmosis uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove contaminants by applying pressure, effectively filtering out dissolved solids and impurities. Ultrafiltration, on the other hand, employs membranes with larger pore sizes to separate larger particles, bacteria, and suspended solids while allowing water and smaller molecules to pass through. Both methods are essential for ensuring clean, safe drinking water in residential, commercial, and industrial applications.</p></p>

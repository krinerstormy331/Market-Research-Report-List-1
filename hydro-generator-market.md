<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydro Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impulse Turbine</li><li>Reaction Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydro generator market encompasses two main types: impulse turbines and reaction turbines. Impulse turbines utilize high-velocity water jets to drive the turbine blades, making them ideal for high-head applications. In contrast, reaction turbines operate by creating a pressure difference, allowing water to flow through the turbine and rotate it, suitable for low-head systems. Both types play a crucial role in renewable energy generation, catering to different site conditions and efficiency requirements in hydroelectric power plants.</p></p>

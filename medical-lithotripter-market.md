<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Lithotripter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intracorporeal Lithotripter</li><li>Extracorporeal Lithotripter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical lithotripter market is primarily divided into two types: intracorporeal and extracorporeal lithotripters. Intracorporeal lithotripters are used for direct treatment within the body, often utilizing laser or ultrasound technology to fragment stones through minimally invasive procedures. In contrast, extracorporeal lithotripters operate outside the body, commonly employing shock waves to disintegrate stones into smaller fragments that can be easily passed. Both types are vital for effective management of kidney and urinary stones, improving patient outcomes and recovery times.</p></p>

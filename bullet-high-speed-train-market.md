<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bullet High-Speed Train Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheel on Rail</li><li>Maglev</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Bullet High-Speed Train market is divided into two primary types: Wheel on Rail and Maglev. Wheel on Rail systems use traditional steel wheels on tracks, offering high speeds (up to 350 km/h) with proven technology and infrastructure compatibility. Maglev (Magnetic Levitation) trains, on the other hand, use magnetic fields to levitate above the tracks, enabling even higher speeds (up to 600 km/h) with reduced friction and noise. While Wheel on Rail is more widespread and cost-effective, Maglev represents cutting-edge innovation with superior speed and efficiency.</p></p>

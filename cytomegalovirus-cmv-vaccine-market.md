<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Attenuated Vaccines</li><li>Subunit Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine market primarily comprises two main types: attenuated vaccines and subunit vaccines. Attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the virus to elicit an immune response, providing long-lasting immunity without causing disease. Conversely, subunit vaccines contain only specific protein components of the virus, stimulating the immune system without the risk of infection. Both types aim to prevent CMV infections, especially in high-risk populations, enhancing public health outcomes and reducing the burden of related complications.</p></p>

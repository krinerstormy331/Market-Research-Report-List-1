<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Measuring Instrument Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contacting</li><li>Contacting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrostatic measuring instrument market is divided into two main types: non-contacting and contacting instruments. Non-contacting instruments measure electrostatic charge or fields without physical contact, making them ideal for sensitive applications where surface damage or contamination is a concern. On the other hand, contacting instruments require direct contact with the surface to measure static electricity, providing more accurate readings in certain environments. Both types serve diverse industries, including electronics, packaging, and healthcare, ensuring effective static charge management.</p></p>
